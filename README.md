**IPL Analysis Dashboard (2008–2025) | Power BI**

I’m thrilled to share my latest Power BI project — an interactive IPL Analysis Dashboard that provides a complete view of the Indian Premier League from 2008 to 2025. The goal of this project was to bring together data-driven insights on team and player performances across all seasons in a visually engaging and interactive way.

**🔹 Project Overview:**
The dashboard offers a comprehensive season-wise analysis of IPL matches, combining team stats, player achievements, and tournament highlights into one powerful visualization platform. Users can easily switch between seasons to explore winners, runners-up, and top performers dynamically.

**🔹 Key Features & Insights:**

**Dynamic KPIs:** Automatically displays the winner and runner-up of each season along with their team logos.

**Performance Metrics:** Includes total sixes, fours, centuries, half-centuries, matches played, teams participated, and venues used.

**Player Highlights:** Showcases Orange Cap and Purple Cap holders with player images, total runs, wickets, and representing teams.

**Top Performers:** Displays players with the most sixes and fours each season, enhancing engagement and comparison.

**Interactive Points Table:** Built using DAX formulas, it dynamically calculates total points, wins, losses, ties, and no-result matches as per IPL rules.

Added interactive slicers and filters to allow users to analyze data by season, team, or player, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

**🔹 Tools & Skills Used:**
Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Data Cleaning | Data Visualization | Dashboard Design

This project not only strengthened my technical skills in Power BI and DAX but also enhanced my ability to transform complex sports data into meaningful, visually appealing insights.
